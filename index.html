                <p>This web page was my first coding experence. The project assesed my skills in HTML and CSS languages. 
                    These languages are basic for programming and highly desirable. 
                    The application was about <strong> <em>my favorite band</em></strong>, Linkin Park. 
                    The application also familiarized use of git and Github as a webhost. <a href="https://mosesvalei.github.io/My-favorite-Band/" target="_blank">link</a></p>
                <h2>Stress free</h2>
                <p>This was a group activity that enabled me understand HTML, JavaScript and CSS commands. 
                    The objective of the project was to design a landing webpage with useful content for mental health.
                    The project also enabled me to work on a collaborative project on GithHub by using the fork options.

                <h1>Who am I</h1>
                <h2>I am Moses Valei, a freelancer, web designer, developer and a programmer</h2>
                <p>I am a registered graduate mechanical engineer with vast skills in engineering concepts, operations management, engineering design and management skills. 
                    I enjoy to have worked in the country's top research centers for innovation and technology including KIRDI. 
                    My job experience at KIRDI enabled me realize that technology is the most important concept in innovation. 
                    This led to quest to join Moringa school for their resourceful career path on programming to actualize my dream on solving problems with technology.
